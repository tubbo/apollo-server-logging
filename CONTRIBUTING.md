# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for contributing to `apollo-server-logging`! This
library accepts contributions of all shapes and sizes, and we appreciate
your input.

If you are having a problem, or want to suggest something that this
project can do, please [create an issue][] if one
[hasn't already been created][].

Want to contribute some code? Make a pull request, and ensure tests/lint
checks/type checks pass. We use [conventional commits][] for our commit
message formatting, so you should ensure you are using the right scopes
and types for your changes. `feat:` and `fix:` commits cause a new
release, and all other commit types are ignored. The scope is completely
optional, and you should only use it if you are absolutely sure of the
scope of your changes, or you wish to group a number of commits
together. Scopes must be `kebab-case` and have no spaces or capital
letters.

Commit messages should also follow a similar format to
https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53.
